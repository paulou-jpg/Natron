TODO and Recommended Fixes
==========================

This chapter collects recommendations that emerged from reviewing the code base
for this guide. It is meant as a living backlog of *technical* work — code
health, correctness and modernization — complementary to the user-facing
backlog analyzed in :ref:`maint-issue-triage`. Items are grouped by theme and
tagged with a rough priority (**P0** highest). Where an item maps to a tracked
issue, the issue is linked.

Toolkit and build modernization
-------------------------------

**Complete Qt 6 support while keeping Qt 5 (P1).**
This is a first-class goal with its own chapter, :ref:`maint-qt6`, which is the
single source of truth for the audited work items and counts. In short: the
CMake build already has a ``NATRON_QT6`` switch and the viewer already uses
``QOpenGLWidget``, so the remaining work is bounded — modernize the removed Qt
APIs (``QRegExp`` → ``QRegularExpression``, ``QDesktopWidget`` → ``QScreen``,
``setMargin``) and regenerate the
PySide6/Shiboken6 bindings (resolving the enum/flag issue
`#854 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/854>`_). Tracks
`#1011 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/1011>`_ and
`#827 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/827>`_.

**Retire the qmake build (done).**
Natron used to maintain *both* qmake and CMake builds, so every structural
change had to touch both. The qmake build has been removed: CMake is now the
only build, dependencies come from ``vcpkg.json``, and
``tools/jenkins/build-natron.sh`` drives CMake directly.

**Modernize CI (P1).**
Migrate CI from Travis to GitHub Actions
(`#601 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/601>`_; the ``.travis.yml``
is already disabled). Build **both** Qt 5 and Qt 6 and run the ``Tests`` suite on
all three platforms so regressions in the dual-toolkit build are caught
automatically.

**Adopt a modern C++ baseline consistently (P3).**
The CMake build already compiles as C++17, and the code has largely moved from
C++98 to ``std::shared_ptr`` etc. Finish the job opportunistically: prefer
``override``, range-based ``for`` (retiring ``foreach``/``Q_FOREACH``, ~46
uses), ``nullptr``, and ``enum class`` where it does not break the Python
bindings. Do this file-by-file alongside other work, not as a mass reformat
(which would fight the astyle hook and bloat diffs).

Stability and correctness (P0)
------------------------------

These are the code-level counterparts of the P0 issues in
:ref:`maint-issue-triage`.

**Make the cache respect its limits (P0).**
`#192 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/192>`_ reports that Natron
does not observe disk/RAM cache size limits and crashes when the disk fills.
Audit ``Cache.h`` / ``MemoryFile`` / ``TileCacheFile`` eviction and the
disk-space checks; a compositor that fills the disk and crashes loses work.

**Diagnose the silent render stall (P0).**
`#248 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/248>`_ (rendering silently
stalls after N frames) points at the scheduler / abort / thread-pool machinery
(``OutputSchedulerThread``, ``GenericSchedulerThread``, ``AbortableRenderInfo``)
or a deadlock around the cache. High value; reproduce under a debug build with
FP-exception trapping and thread sanitizer.

**Fix launch/teardown crashes (P0).**
Startup crashes (`#845 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/845>`_,
`#1008 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/1008>`_) and
shutdown/lifecycle crashes (`#795 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/795>`_,
`#1029 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/1029>`_,
`#1057 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/1057>`_) recur across
platforms. Several likely involve OpenGL context creation
(`#516 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/516>`_, amdgpu-pro) — a
good place to add defensive checks and clearer diagnostics in ``OSGLContext_*``.

**Invest in the crash-reporting pipeline (P1).**
A large tail of issues are "random crashes" with no stack trace
(`#557 <https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/557>`_). Making the
Breakpad reporter reliably deliver usable minidumps/symbols converts that tail
into fixable, evidence-backed bugs. High leverage.

Robustness of critical subsystems
---------------------------------

**Guard the serialization format (P1).**
Project loading uses Boost.Serialization (see :ref:`maint-design`). There is no
automated test that round-trips and cross-version-loads real project files.
Recommendation: add regression tests that load a corpus of old ``.ntp`` files
and assert they still open; require a ``BOOST_CLASS_VERSION`` bump review for any
``*Serialization`` change. This directly protects users from data loss.

**Replace deprecated/removed Qt string and regex APIs (P1).**
Beyond Qt 6 compatibility, ``QRegExp`` and the ``QDesktopWidget`` family are the
concrete deprecated APIs in use; migrating them (details in :ref:`maint-qt6`)
improves the Qt 5 build immediately and is low-risk since the replacements exist
in Qt 5.15.

**Reduce the size of the largest translation units (P3).**
Several files are enormous (``Node.cpp``, ``EffectInstance.cpp`` and
``EffectInstanceRenderRoI.cpp``, ``Knob.cpp``, ``RotoContext.cpp``,
``Settings.cpp``, ``OfxParamInstance.cpp`` — each 100–240 KB). They are hard to
navigate and slow to compile. Where a natural seam exists (as the numbered GUI
files already show), split them into cohesive units. Do this incrementally and
only when already working in the file.

Testing and documentation
-------------------------

**Broaden automated test coverage (P2).**
The ``Tests`` suite covers curves, LUT, images, hashing, tracking and the
file-system model, but not the render pipeline, the cache, serialization, or
knob expressions — the subsystems where the P0 bugs live. Add targeted tests as
these areas are touched; a headless ``NatronRenderer`` render of a known project
compared against a golden image would be a strong end-to-end regression test.

**Keep this Maintainer Guide current (P2).**
Update it when the architecture changes — especially the Qt 6 status in
:ref:`maint-qt6`, and re-run the :ref:`maint-issue-triage` analysis periodically
(the script used to produce it is simple GitHub-API + label aggregation).

**Label and prune the issue tracker (P2).**
As noted in :ref:`maint-issue-triage`, ~half of issues are untriaged and ~124
are 2018 imports that may already be fixed. A labeling/pruning pass makes the
backlog trustworthy and surfaces genuinely actionable work.
